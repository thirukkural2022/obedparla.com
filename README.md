This is the source code for my personal website and blog [obedparla.com](https://obedparla.com).

It's a fully static site built with Gatsby.js that maximizes speed (both of the website and of development) and simplicity.

## Why?
I've had my blog as a Wordpress website for more than 5 years and it sufficed, but it was a barrier for me to easily modify my site or add new cool features, so I decided to move away from that into something I enjoy working with!

I also wanted to showcase React projects without having to use a different domain or think too much about it. Which is complicated within Wordpress.

Simplicity rules.

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - Fast, efficient development
- [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) - Extremely powerful static site generator for React
- [Gatsby Advanced Started](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter) - A skeleton started for Gatsby that takes away a lot of boiler plate
- [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) - Great CSS-in-JS library
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - Don't think about how your code looks but how it works

Do keep in mind this is a personal website so it has a lot of modifications to the Gatsby Advanced Started theme.
You'd be wiser to use that instead of trying to base work off this repo, but please feel free to use this as an inspiration!
