This is the source code for my personal website and blog [obedparla.com](https://obedparla.com).

It's a fully static site built with Gatsby.js that maximizes speed (both of the website and of development) and simplicity.

## Why?
I've had my blog as a Wordpress website for more than 5 years and it sufficed, but a lot of the time I never improved it or added new features because I don't enjoy working with Wordpress, so I decided to move away from that into something I enjoy working with!

I also wanted to showcase React projects without having to use a different domain or think too much about it. Which is complicated within Wordpress.

Simplicity rules.

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - Fast, efficient development
- [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) - Extremely powerful static site generator for React
- [Gatsby Advanced Started](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter) - A skeleton started for Gatsby that takes away a lot of boiler plate
- [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) - Great CSS-in-JS library
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - Don't think about how your code looks but how it works
