I sit alone on the couch. Holding more computer power that ever thought possible. Hugging bits and bytes. Pixels and pretty animations. Finding relief in the warmth of a screen. Losing myself in seemingly endless, mindless distraction. Busy mind, quiet heart.

Tap, tap, tap. My fingers never cease. Tap, tap, tap. To create useless junk. Tap, tap, tap. That wont be remembered.

Life is but a mystery, an adventure and a dilemma. Stop to think twice and you find yourself dead. The train moves too fast to appreciate the beauty of the landscape. Yet some are brave enough to jump into the void. I wonder where they find themselves right after. Broken bones and cries of pain. Or sweet dreams coming true.
