### Would you? Kill.

##### Kill to prove you're right.

##### That you're ideas are above everyone else's ideas.

##### Would you kill to save your life?

##### What would you kill for?

##### Would you start a war. A war to defend what is yours. Or a war to take what does not belongs to you. What is either your birthright, or just a growing fell to conquer.

##### Would you yell, to inspire fear into your enemies or encourage your followers.

##### Would your blood be worth the sacrifice?

##### Would the honor be worth it?

##### Would you kill to be the conqueror of what your heart most desires?
