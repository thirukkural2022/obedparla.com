I am a warm, friendly person who smiles just for the sake of it.

I am a warm, friendly person who smiles to make you smile with me.

I am a warm, friendly person who has strong muscles in his face, because of so much smiling. Ok you get the point.

I am a warm, friendly person who will open his heart if that means winning yours.

I am a warm, friendly person who will never betray you.

I am a warm, friendly person who will be at your side forever if you are worthy.

I am a warm, friendly person who loves forever, through time and space, sadly, without a blue box.

I am... I am a cold, lonely person. Who understands his coldness, and enjoys his loneliness.

I hope i was just a mad man with a blue box. But sadly i am not mad enough, and haven't found my box yet. Not the blue one, not any other one.
