To win all you have to do is lie.

To lie means to win, but winning doesn't necessarily means to lie.

To lie is so easy, so tempting, that you can even lie to yourself, "I don't want it", "I want it". The lies are rooted so deep inside of us, the world have taught us so well to lie, that some people, hell, some of us have a hard time seeing the truth in ourselves.

Is the truth worth it? Is the Truth worth the sacrifice of letting go the easy path. Well, that is a question and an answer that just you can answer. For me? Yes, totally. It is worth. Because a Lie is nothing more than a non existingÂ  parallel world, created by you, you can give life to it, but most likely it will burn in flames after a while. In big, exotic, problematic and awesome flames.

If you are into that kind of burning, then there is no need to make or answer the previous question at all. But me, at least, i like the world we live in, i like the sunshine in it, and like it says "The truth will set you free". Free of everybody but yourself.

Let's be free.
