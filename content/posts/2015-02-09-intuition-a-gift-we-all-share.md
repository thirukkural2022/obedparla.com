There is this thing called Intuition.

I read a book about it when I was in high school, when, well, I didn't use to read that much. It took me like 2 or 3 weeks to finish it, and by that time it was "So fast" to read a book in 2 weeks. Dull me.

The book was by "Osho", by the way. It was, and still is, one of the best books I've read.

Not really because of the book itself, it's not a story or anything, but I thanks to it I understood what I already knew, it helped me put all the pieces of a puzzle together, it showed me the truth I was looking for, maybe without knowing I needed it.

That book opened some doors to a knowledge I believe everyone should have. Intuition is not a magician stuff, I don't see anybody calling their mothers sorcerers, yet almost everyone comes to trust a "Mother feeling". I know I have, because more than once, when I was a kid, and my mother wasn't "Feeling good" about something, or she had "A bad feeling" about someone, well, something eventually happened. "Trust your gut" as they say.

And everyone just accepts this "gift" as a mother's gift, they must have such a gift, for they have to protect their children. Mothers trust this feeling, because they know how it protects her little ones. My mother attributes this gift to God, of course, God is telling her there is something wrong with her blond little boy, when he's running around like crazy —I used to be blond :'(—.

But hey, do women get this gift once they have a child? Or is it just women in general that have this weird thing? And if so, isn't it, well, sexist from God to give women such a useful thing and not us? Men?

Meh. We all have it. And it's as much a gift as your instinct of survival is. You feel fear in the darkness. You feel the rush of the adrenaline in extreme moments. Yet you don't judge them as magical things.

Intuition is a gift we all have. And just like instinct, we shall understand it in order to appreciate it, to apply and hear it.
