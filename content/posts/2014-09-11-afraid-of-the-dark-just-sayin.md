I live, we live, i mean, all of us, are living in a new revolution. Even bigger than the industrial revolution. And us, with 20+ years old, dispensable as we are, afraid of the future, how not to be? The cars are going around by themself on the street, and they drive better than us. Algorithms that are way smarter than us, faster, and overall cheaper. Making thousands of songs for just cents, even art. How not to be afraid if what we call society, or jobs, or whatever you can think of, is being replaced by a not so living creature created of code and that feeds of nothing, nevertheless growing stronger everytime a new update is live. But after all, there is still Fb to share this, and some other bot reading my metadata to sell me some new stuff on amazon, hello there. Yes, i like potatos and pizza.

Oh hello there you gorgeous human reading my stuff. Yes i know you like what u see, you litle bastard <3.
