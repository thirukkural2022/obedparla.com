What would you answer if someone asks you in your deathbed 'How was it to live in earth?'. What would you answer?

The question must be ask in the last moments of your life, when no hope of one more day exists, because that hope would distort the answer. So, what would you answer? How was it to spend all your life, every day, every minute and second of every week, contained in months, contained in years, contained in decades, contained in your lifetime. How was it?

Did you enjoy living in this weird place full of amazing people? Or the same people made your life so miserable that the only possible answer would be 'Earth is Hell'.

Or, in the other hand, through your eyes and in the years long gone you saw the wonders of the world, you fell in love and got hurt, you had dreams came true, and watched other dreams being crushed by the enormous weight of reality. How was it to live in Earth?

It was nothing but a small journey, you visited this town just to get the ticket and waited a bit for the bus, and so, you went to some other place, without time to wonder around and enjoy the beauty contained within the town walls. And that is life, nothing but a small journey, we are limited to being in one place at the time, one body, one experience, and even if you could be in a different place every day, would 24 hours be enough to enjoy it? To understand the different people living in different corners of this big blue and (not so much) green "Balloon".

– How was it living in Earth?

– I don't know, I went through once, but I have never really been there.

And, that's the only possible answer?. I don't know. I have no idea how it was to live in Earth, I have never been really there, I just have had the wondrous opportunity to be in some of Earth's places, to meet some of Earth's living creatures, to fall in love with some of Earth's offspring. Because after all, we are Earth's offspring, and all of our creations are just Earth's toys.

I don't know, I am going through it, I am trying to actually live in this place, but so far, it has been completely awesome.

– How was it living in Earth?

– I don't know, I went through once, maybe I will go back again, it was quite a journey.
